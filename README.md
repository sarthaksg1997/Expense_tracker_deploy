I have created a Expense tracker App using MERN stack

UI side : I have created a interactive UI using React, chart.js, Context-API and Material-UI. UI consists of three pages: Register, Login and Main page where user can manage and track the income/expenses by using Pie-charts.

Server side: I am storing user data and handling JWT Authentication using Nodejs, Express and MongoDB.
